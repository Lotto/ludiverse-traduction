As a publisher, you've created an extraordinary game that deserves to reach an international audience. Translation is the crucial step that will allow your creation to cross linguistic boundaries. Here are my 5 tips to optimize this process.

## 1. Anticipate translation from the design phase

**The most common mistake**: waiting for the game to be completely finalized before thinking about translation.

The best approach is to integrate the international dimension from the design phase. A few questions to ask yourself:
- Are texts on components easily modifiable?
- Is there enough space for more verbose languages?
- Are cultural references universal?

> "Thinking internationally from the start saves you many complications later."

## 2. Create a complete file

To get a quality translation, your translator needs to understand your universe. A complete file should include:

### Essential documents
- **Final version of rules** with layout
- **Glossary of specific terms** to the game
- **Thematic context** and inspiration references
- **Target audience** and marketing positioning

### Visual elements
- Photos of final components
- Examples of played games
- Illustrations representative of the universe

## 3. Choose the right translator

Not all translators are equal in the gaming field. Essential criteria:

**Gaming specialization**: Does the translator play regularly? Do they know the codes of the field?

**Sector experience**: Have they already translated games similar to yours?

**Technical skills**: Do they master layout software if necessary?

**Collaborative approach**: Are they open to exchanges and adjustments?

## 4. Plan testing phases

A game translation can only be validated through the game itself.

### Recommended tests
1. **Blank reading**: Verification of terminological consistency
2. **Test game** with translated rules
3. **Validation by native speakers** of the target language
4. **Adjustments** based on feedback

This testing phase can reveal ambiguities invisible to simple reading.

## 5. Allow time for adjustments

A quality translation is never perfect on the first try. Include in your schedule:

- **Collaborative revision** phase
- **Adaptations** following tests
- **Final validation** of all elements
- **Buffer** for unforeseen issues

### Recommended timeline
- **Initial translation**: 70% of time
- **Tests and revisions**: 25% of time  
- **Finalization**: 5% of time

## The secret of successful translation

An excellent game translation is born from **collaboration** between publisher and translator. The more you involve your translator in your game's universe, the better they can recreate its essence in the target language.

Don't hesitate to share your passion for your creation. A translator who understands and loves your game will naturally produce better quality work.
